Welcome!
=
I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/), supervised by Prof. [Ming Hu](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/21567-ming-hu), Prof. [Hansheng Jiang](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/53438-hansheng-jiang) and Prof. [Sheng Liu](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/21123-sheng-liu). I earned my Ph.D. in the Department of [Systems Engineering & Engineering Management](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) under the guidance of Prof. [Daniel Zhuoyu Long](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~zylong/). 
Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Industrial Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) in 2020.

My research focuses on modeling and robust optimization in the diverse context of healthcare, discrete choice models, and revenue management. You can find my CV [here](../assets/YuSunCV.pdf).
