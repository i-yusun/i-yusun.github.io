Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of [Systems Engineering & Engineering Management](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) under the guidance of Prof. [Daniel Zhuoyu Long](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~zylong/). 
Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Industrial Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) in 2020.

My research focuses on modeling and robust optimization in the diverse context of healthcare, discrete choice models, and revenue management. You can find my CV [here](../assets/YuSunCV.pdf).
